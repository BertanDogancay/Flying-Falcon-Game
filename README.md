# Flying-Falcon-Game
A game that is made by using Unity editor and Visual Studio. It is a simple ten level game inspired from "Angry Birds". The rules are very straight fordard. Little purple monsters are on random places like at the top of a crate and they dissapear only if they are hit from above. Every level is a bit harder than the previous one and the game should take about 15-20 minutes to complete. It is a nice game to start learning stuff in game development with Unity. You can download the game from this repository.

A main menu also included in the game which allows you to select different levels and start or quit the game. The option button in the main menu is not working at the moment since there is no function given to it. If you want to create an option menu in the future, the button can be used. This is only a demo game. It consists of 10 levels and it still requires a lot of improvement in the areas like main menu, level building, UI etc. in order to become an actual game.

***NOTE: This game has downloading option for only Windows operating system.***
